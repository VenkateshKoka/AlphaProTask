{"s":1972.33,"e":1988.83,"p":"25","S":"2","t":"But from a shipment standpoint, in Q4 and early Q1, shipments kind of leveled off the pre COVID levels We've seen some general seasonality and there's some regional weather impacts here and there.","counter":210}

{"s":2043.98,"e":2061.56,"p":"26","S":"3","t":"I think something that I would point out and it did in addition to what Mark said, if you look at take into consideration that volumes are to Mark's point, at a pre COVID level, but earnings were still from an operating income perspective about over $1200 per ton.","counter":215}

{"s":2081.98,"e":2108.42,"p":"27","S":"4","t":"Allow these public the CHIPS Act and the IRA Act, there's a lot of work that has to happen upfront And once those projects are owners are identified and engineering companies are identified, that's when it starts flowing into all the steel products, but specifically when we look at the joist and deck, once it's a concrete kind of a plan of what's going to be built, The timeline is actually pretty quick.","counter":218}
{"s":2108.42,"e":2114.95,"p":"27","S":"4","t":"So when those orders start being placed, it's typically typically in a kind of a 3 to 6 month window when they start shipping.","counter":219}

{"s":2534.94,"e":2542.64,"p":"48","S":"4","t":"So we see a really good path to 80% progressing through operational by the end of the year getting up in the capacity.","counter":289}

{"s":2553.6,"e":2560.45,"p":"48","S":"4","t":"And through all this, they remain a very safe operation, which is so important during startup.","counter":292}
{"s":2560.45,"e":2571.115,"p":"48","S":"4","t":"So the teams in place, the new assets will allow us to provide the best mix possible upstream so that the efficiency that of the plant can really be explored further.","counter":293}
